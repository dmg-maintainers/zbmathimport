# Import projects from zbmaths

This is an extension of the [academic](https://github.com/GetRD/academic-file-converter) project, to retrieve publication data from the [zbMath](zbmath.org) repository for a list of authors and generate publication data compatible with static website generators such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
